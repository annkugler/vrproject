## About me

Hello! My name is Anna-Maria Kugler and I am a student of the TU Darmstadt.
After I have already finishing my B.Sc.in Cognitive Science at the start of the year,
I decided to continue with the masters degree in the same course of study.

## This project

In this project we are dealing with the subject of human computer interaction.
The aim is to develop and implement a locomotion technique in a virtual world.
My idea is, to develop a strategy, that is very intuitive and also allows people,
who are not used to technology like VR to learn the game mechanics really quickly.
